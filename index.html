      <h3 class="sub-headline">What is Vibe Coding?</h3>
      <h4 class="author">By MeMasterCode</h4>
      <p class="text">Vibe coding is a way to program using Artificial Intelligence (AI), specifically Large Language Models (LLMs). The term gained attention through Andrej Karpathy, co-founder of OpenAI, who described it as trusting the "vibes"—letting AI handle the coding details. He said it feels like: "It's not really coding—I just see stuff, say stuff, run stuff, and copy-paste stuff, and it mostly works."</p>
      
      <p class="text">This method involves using plain language to instruct the AI, heavily relying on AI to write code, and focusing less on exact coding rules and more on outcomes. A significant concern, noted by researchers like Simon Willison, is using AI-generated code without fully understanding it—distinct from using AI merely as typing assistance.</p>

      <p class="text">Vibe coding utilises various AI tools. Code editors with AI assistance, like GitHub Copilot, Cursor, or Replit Agent, act as coding partners, translating descriptions into working code. Additionally, general AI models like Claude or ChatGPT and new tools like Lovable or Softr are specifically designed for vibe coding.</p>
